# SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR NEUROSCIENTISTS

Workshop demo for neuroscience audiences showcasing MATLAB capabilities.  
Takes participants through a standard neurophysiology signal processing workflow with pre-recorded data.
Illustrates timetables, filtering, pca, clustering using Gaussian mixture models, computing power spectra and time frequency plots (spectrogram)
Points to the signal analyzer app at appropriate points.

Ideally, participants would run this with their own data which needs to be similarly organized to the data provided. (voltage values and sampling frequency)
