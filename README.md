# SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR NEUROSCIENTISTS

Workshop demo for neuroscience audiences showcasing MATLAB capabilities.  
Takes participants through a standard neurophysiology signal processing workflow with pre-recorded data.
Illustrates timetables, filtering, pca, clustering using Gaussian mixture models, computing power spectra and time frequency plots (spectrogram)
Points to the signal analyzer app at appropriate points.

For the demo to run, the neural_data.mat file is required

To run this demo, you require
1. MATLAB and the Signal Processing Toolbox. You can get access via your school's license or download a free trial from https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html
2. the accompanying file neural_data.mat which should be in the same folder as the Live Script
3. If you want to run it with your own data, make a copy of the file neural_data.mat, save it under a different name and create your own file neural_data.mat which should contain two variables
    a. data: an array of voltage values
    b. fs: a scalar denoting the sampling frequency in Hz
